# jca-python-projects
Please find here some programs or pieces of code that I developed using Python.  
I am using PyCharm with GitHub to update these files.
Some of the projects are common 'first programs' for beginners.
## Instructions
- Check requirements.
- Execute 'main.py' to see how the program works. Otherwise, execute the only file in the folder.
- For API projects, please note that you will need to modify some of the variables.  
  *You will not find my keys in the programs. Also, you may want to use environment variables. Feel free to include the required code to do so.  
## Projects
Note that every folder will (unless otherwise noted) hold only one single program. In some cases it is only a default class that I found interesting to build (like a class to control APIs).  
<em>List of projects:</em>
- Password generator and storage.
- Flash Cards: A game to learn Spanish.
  + V2 20221101 - Redesign of the full program.

   + Files - Function Converter: Gather data from a file, execute the calculations required and then save the results into another file.
