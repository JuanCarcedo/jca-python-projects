# Python Projects
Please find here some programs or pieces of code that I developed using Python.  
I am using PyCharm with GitHub to update these files.  

## Instructions
- Create a Fork of the repository (you can access all projects).
- Open your favourite IDE (I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)).
- Check the ***[requirements.txt](https://github.com/JuanCarcedo/jca-python-projects/blob/main/requirements.txt)*** file.  
  
## How to use
Instructions of how to use are provided in each folder. Mostly it will require you to run the ```main.py``` file.  

## Projects
Note that every folder will (unless otherwise noted) hold only one single program. In some cases it is only a default class that I found interesting to build.  
<em>List:</em>
- Password generator and storage.
- Flash Cards: A game to learn Spanish.
  + V2 20221101 - Redesign of the full program.
- Turtle Crossing: My first game. Reach higher levels reaching the other side of the big road.
  + V2 20221028 - High score included.
- Email platform simple simulator: Simulator of an inbox.

With SQLite:  
- Bookstore: Bookstore data management with database. Note there is an external class to manage the interaction with the database. 

_Others_:
- File check data: Initial checks (counting items) for txt files.
- Files - Function Converter: Gather data from a file, execute the calculations required and then save the results into another file.
- Task Manager: Base for a task manager program with admin and user menus and options.
- finance_calculator: Interest calculation on a loan or an investment (simple, compound).

_Re-usable classes_:
I use these classes in many of my own programs.  
- Dataframe Check: Class to do some basic first checks to a set of data in Pandas.
- SQLite Test: Class to manage/handle simple SQLite requests (create table, update table...).
