# jca-python-projects
Please find here some programs or pieces of code that I developed using Python.  
I am using PyCharm with GitHub to update these files.  
Some of the projects are common 'first programs' for beginners.
## Instructions
- Check requirements.
- Execute 'main.py' to see how the program works. Otherwise, execute the only file in the folder.
  
## Projects
Note that every folder will (unless otherwise noted) hold only one single program. In some cases it is only a default class that I found interesting to build.  
<em>List of projects:</em>
- Password generator and storage.
- Flash Cards: A game to learn Spanish.
  + V2 20221101 - Redesign of the full program.
- Turtle Crossing: Reach higher levels reaching the other side of the big road.
  + V2 20221028 - High score included.
