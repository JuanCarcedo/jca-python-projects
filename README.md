# jca-python-projects
Please find here some programs or pieces of code that I developed using Python.  
Some of the projects are common 'first programs' for beginners.
## Instructions
- Check requirements.
- Execute 'main.py' to see how the program works.
- For API projects, please note that you will need to modify some of the variables.  
  *You will not find my keys in the programs. Also, you may want to use environment variables. Feel free to include the required code to do so.  
## Projects
Note that every folder will (unless otherwise noted) hold only one single program. In some cases it is only a default class that I found interesting to build (like a class to control APIs).  
<em>List of projects:</em>
- Password generator and storage.
- Flash Cards: A game to learn Spanish.
- Turtle Crossing: Reach higher levels reaching the other side of the big road.
